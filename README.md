# habit-blocks

An iPhone app to track your habits and view your consistency with a homescreen widget.

## Breakdown

Credits to [Artem Novichkov](https://www.artemnovichkov.com/blog/github-contribution-graph-swift-charts) for the explained breakdown when recreating the idea of a GitHub contribution graph.

Each graph is essentially a heatmap, where:

- x-axis represents the weeks (labeled with the corresponding months)
- y-axis displays the weekdays (labeled with Mon, Wed, and Fri)
- Value indicates the count of habits completed
- Legend shows color gradient
